      <h3>How we secure personal information</h3>
                            <p>SurePeople is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. While we have implemented reasonable security measures to safeguard personal information, please keep in mind that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.</p>
                            <h3>How you can review or request changes to your personal information</h3>
                            <h5>Registered User</h5>
                            <p>You may review the personal information we have collected regarding you at any time by accessing your SurePeople profile settings. If you need to make any changes or corrections to your personal information please do so here. If you are unable to do this yourself, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@surepeople.com">privacy@surepeople.com</a> and describe specifically what needs to be changed, up to deletion of your SurePeople profile. We will try to complete your request as promptly and reasonably possible as permitted under applicable law. We reserve the right to request documentation from you to support any changes to the information.</p>
                            <p>In some circumstances, SurePeople collects information under the direction of its Clients and therefore has no direct relationship with the Registered Users whose personal information it processes on behalf of its Clients. A Registered User who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate personal data should direct their query to the data owner (i.e., SurePeopleâ€™s Client). If the Client requests that SurePeople remove this personal data, SurePeople will respond to their request within 30 business days of its receipt of such request.</p>
                            <h5>Public User</h5>
                            <p>Upon request, SurePeople will make a reasonable effort to provide you whether we hold any of your personal information within reasonable time. Users may request updates, deletion, access, or changes to their personal information by contacting us at privacy@surepeople.com or by call us at 1-855-755-SURE (7873). We will respond to any requests for access to personal information within 30 days of receipt of such request.</p>
